DESCRIPTION
-----------
This archive contains an ANSI C library implementing arbitrary length arrays
of bits.  The library is intended to be easy to follow and expand upon,
though it may be used without an understanding of its implementation.

FILES
-----
bitarray.c      - Library providing operations on arbitrary length arrays
                  of bits.
bitarray.h      - Header for bitarray library.
COPYING         - GNU General Public License Version 3
COPYING.LESSER  - GNU Lesser General Public License Version 3
sample.c        - Program demonstrating how to use the bitarray library.
Makefile        - makefile for this project (assumes gcc compiler and GNU make)
README          - this file

BUILDING
--------
To build these files with GNU make and gcc, simply enter "make" from the
command line.

USAGE
-----
sample.c demonstrates usage of each of the bitarray functions.

HISTORY
-------
01/30/04 - Initial release

           handling array memory allocation failures.
08/26/07 - Updated for LGPL v3 release.

TODO
